# üè† **Real-Estate-React-Application**

Welcome to the **Real Estate React Application**, a fully functional web platform that helps customers predict the value of properties based on their chosen layout, location, and other features. This application uses machine learning to generate price predictions based on various property attributes.

## üåü **Project Overview**

The **Real Estate React Application** provides users with the ability to:

- Explore real estate properties.
- View predicted property prices.
- Submit feedback on predictions.

It leverages **machine learning** and **neural networks** to predict the prices based on property features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The user-friendly interface is built using **React** and provides a seamless experience for users.
